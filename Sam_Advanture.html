        <p>You are the captain of a spaceship named "The Flying Hippo." One day, you're working on tuning up your ship's engines when you get an urgent message on your space phone:</p>
        <p>"Captain, one of our Mars robots is sick. We need you to go to Mars immediately and retrieve it so that we can fix it and download the results of its important experiments."</p>
        <p>You remember that you're supposed to go to a meeting of the Space Scouts tonight, and you were really looking forward to it. But, on the other hand, the other Space Scouts would understand that this mission is very important.</p>
        <p>What do you do? Go to Mars, or stay home?</p>
